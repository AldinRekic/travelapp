## March 19, 2024 - Refocusing the App's Message
Today we made significant changes to the app's messaging and focus. The main changes were:

1. Updated the landing page messaging:
   - Changed main title to "Track Your Trips, Save the Climate"
   - Added subtitle "And your wallet too"
   - Revised feature highlights to emphasize both environmental and financial benefits
   - Added climate impact as a primary benefit alongside cost savings

2. Modified the user profile page:
   - Renamed to "My Climate Journey"

   - Kept the financial overview component but prepared it for future climate impact metrics

3. Refined the value proposition:

   - Preserved the navigation structure

2. Data Structure:
   - Current trip data structure supports future climate metrics
   - Transport types are categorized for impact calculations
